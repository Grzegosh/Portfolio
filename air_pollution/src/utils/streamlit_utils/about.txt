This application was created in order to show the air quality in Poland. In this dashboard we're displaying the data
for cities that shared information about many parameters from their sensors. By now, we have the data for January 2025
but in the future there will be no problem to gather more data and display them in dashboard. On the left side of
this application You can see a Navigation Panel from which you can navigate around different aspects of this dashboard.

In this application we gather measures from several pollutants:

**PM10**: airborne particles with diameter of 10 micrometers. These particles are mix of road dust, dirt and smoke.
Main sources of PM10 are:
    -- Road dust,
    -- Industrial emissions,
    -- Vehicle exhausts,


**PM25**: airborne particles with that are 2.5 micrometers or smaller in diameter. Because of their smaller size
they tend to penetrate deep into our lungs and even bloodstream, making them more dangerous than larger particles such
as PM10.
Main sources of PM25 are:
    -- Combustion of wood, gasoline, oil, diesel fuel,
    -- Coal burning power plants,
    -- Small scale waste burning.


**O3**: Ozone is a gas that is composed from three oxygen atoms. Ground level ozone is a major air pollutant and key
component of smog.
Main sources of ground level O3 are:
    -- Chemical plants,
    -- Industrial boilers,
    -- Pollution emited from cars.


**SO2**: Sulfur Dioxide  is a colorless, pungent gas that primarily comes from burning sulfur-containing fuels like coal, oil, and diesel.
Itâ€™s a major air pollutant and a contributor to acid rain.
Main sources of SO2 are:
        -- Burning fossil fuels,
        -- Shipping emissions,
        -- Natural sources.
